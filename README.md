How this would work:

- Use GitHub issues to organise reading items
  - Open issues are things to read
  - Closed issues are things that have been read
- Build a static website with Netlify
- Use eleventy-plugin-text-to-speech for audio
- Use Netlify build caching
- Use Shortcuts to add items with Edge Functions - eg. easy share on iPhone, mac
- Could use Netlify Graph to handle GitHub interactions?
- Use Netlify Edge Functions to manage items
- Would need to use some sort of GitHub auth to make sure I am me
