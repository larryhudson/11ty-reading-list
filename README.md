How this would work:

- DONE - Use GitHub issues to organise reading items
  - Open issues are things to read
  - DONE - Automatically rebuild when a new issue is added
- Build a static website with Netlify
- DONE - Use eleventy-plugin-text-to-speech for audio
- DONE - Use Netlify build caching
- TO DO - Use Shortcuts to add items with Edge Functions - eg. easy share on iPhone, mac
- Could use Netlify Graph to handle GitHub interactions?
  - No need - octokit + Eleventy data is enough
- TO DO - Use Netlify Edge Functions to manage items
- Would need to use some sort of GitHub auth to make sure I am me
- TO DO - convert HTML to SSML for better speech quality
